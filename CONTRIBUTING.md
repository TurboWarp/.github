# Contributing Guidelines

Some of TurboWarp's repositories are forks of Scratch: scratch-gui, scratch-vm, scratch-render, scratch-svg-renderer, and scratch-paint. These repositories have some special instructions denoted with **For Scratch forks:**

## Bugs

TurboWarp bugs should *never* be reported to the Scratch "Bugs & Glitches" forum. Instead, you should report bugs by either:

 - Opening a GitHub issue in the relavent repository. If you're not sure which repository, just open it here and it will get moved to the right spot,
 - or commenting on this Scratch profile: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/GarboMuffin/#comments

Keep in mind that you're supposed to be at least 13 years old to have a GitHub account. If you're too young to have a GitHub account, it's perfectly fine to report things on Scratch.

**For Scratch forks:** You should check to see if the bug occurs in Scratch itself. Bugs that exist in Scratch are Scratch bugs and should be submitted to Scratch, not to TurboWarp.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests will be accepted for pretty much any open issue that isn't labeled "wontfix" or "upstream". Pull requests, especially small ones, don't necessarily need to have a matching issue.

**For Scratch forks:** When submitting the pull request, make sure that you set the base repository to the TurboWarp fork, not to Scratch itself, as GitHub is sometimes inconsistent about this. For example, a pull request to the TurboWarp VM should be made against TurboWarp/scratch-vm, not LLK/scratch-vm.

Pull requests may take a while to be reviewed and the reviewer can often be quite nitpicky.
