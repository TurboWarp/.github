# Contributing Guidelines

## Bugs

If applicable, see if the bug occurs in Scratch itself. Bugs that exist in Scratch are Scratch bugs and should be submitted to Scratch, not to TurboWarp.

TurboWarp bugs should never be reported to the Scratch "Bugs & Glitches" forum. Instead, you should report bugs by either:

 - Opening a GitHub issue in the relavent repository. If you're not sure which repository, just open it here and it will get moved to the right spot,
 - or commenting on this Scratch profile: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/GarboMuffin/#comments

Keep in mind that you're supposed to be at least 13 years old to have a GitHub account. If you're too young to have a GitHub account, it's perfectly fine to report things on Scratch.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests will be accepted for pretty much any open issue that isn't labeled "wontfix". Pull requests, especially small ones, don't necessarily need to have a matching issue.

When submitting the pull request, make sure that you set the base repository to TurboWarp and not Scratch as GitHub is sometimes inconsistent about this. For example, a pull request to the TurboWarp VM should be made against TurboWarp/scratch-vm, not LLK/scratch-vm.
